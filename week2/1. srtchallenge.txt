HALLENGE 1: LOGIC PROBLEM
The teacher asks his 5 students if they studied mathematics yesterday.

Alice: "Nobody studied math yesterday".
Bob: "1 person studied math yesterday".
Charlie: "2 people studied math yesterday".
Dan: "3 people studied mathematics yesterday".
Eva: "4 people studied mathematics yesterday".

The teacher knows that only those who studied would be telling the truth and those who didn't would be lying. Who is telling the truth?

As we can see, everyone have a 20% of posibility telling the truth. So we have to compares the answers bofore we choose the real one.
number 1. nobody cannot study because there most to be one. 0%
number 2. is possible to be just one. 0%
number 3. is posible because it makes the 40%.}
number 4. about the third one, we can say that it has a 30%.
number 5. is not possible because people in general could not study. 30%

The correct is Charlie´s answer because it is more logical, it has a 70% because students don´t like mucho the math.
